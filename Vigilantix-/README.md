# Vigilantix
A Security App which Lets you Track nearby Cammera and Police Stations  

Our project was inspired by the desire to create a tool that would help people travel safely by providing real-time information on nearby police stations and cameras. We wanted to use technology to empower individuals and increase their sense of security while on the move. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️💻

Before starting Vigilantix, we worked on several projects that involved data analysis and visualization. Through these experiences, we learned about the importance of data quality, user-centered design, and ethical data collection practices. We also gained valuable experience in using various data analysis tools and programming languages. 📊🔍👨‍💻

To build the project, we relied on a combination of web scraping techniques, data analysis tools, machine learning algorithms, Django, and the OpenRouteService API. We also worked closely with law enforcement agencies to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the information provided. We collected the data for Police Stations individually as the data wasn't available freely on the Internet🌐🔍🤖👥

One of the biggest challenges we faced was data quality. It was difficult to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on police stations and cameras in some areas. We also had to be mindful of privacy concerns and ensure that our data collection methods were ethical and legal. 🔍🚓📉👮‍♀️👮‍♂️

What's next for Vigilantix? We plan to continue improving the accuracy and coverage of our data by working with more law enforcement agencies and expanding our web scraping capabilities. We also aim to enhance the user experience by adding additional features and improving the interface. Ultimately, our goal is to make Untitled the go-to tool for anyone looking to travel safely and confidently. 📈🌟👨‍💻👩‍💻
